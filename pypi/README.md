# NOTICE

The Timer CLI is deprecated and is no longer maintained.

Please use the [Globus CLI](https://docs.globus.org/cli/) instead.
It supports much of the same functionality
but also contains commands for interacting with other Globus services.

For a summary of equivalent commands and options between the Timer CLI and the Globus CLI,
please review [the migration guide](https://github.com/globus/globus-timer-cli/blob/HEAD/MIGRATING.rst).
